        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            
<li>200 grams (2 cups) quick-cooking oats (certified gluten-free as needed)</li>
<li>100 grams (1/2 cup) muscovado sugar or other unrefined cane sugar</li>
<li> 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
<li>130 grams (2/3 cup) coconut oil, softened (substitute the same weight in unsalted butter, softened)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons strong coffee, cooled (substitute non-dairy milk or water if avoiding caffeine)</li>
<li>35 grams (1/3 cup) unsweetened grated coconut, for coating</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
    <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the oats, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Process in a few short pulses to grind the oats to a fine powder.</li>
    <li>Tip into a large mixing bowl. Add the coconut oil and coffee, and mix, first with a dough whisk or spatula, then with your hands, until a dough forms. It should be slightly sticky.</li>
    <li>Scoop out rounded tablespoons of the dough and roll into balls. Set aside as you go.</li>
    <li>In a shallow soup plate, put the grated coconut. Roll the balls in the coconut to coat.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. I like them best brought slightly back to room temperature before eating.</li>
    <li>The chocolate balls will keep fresh for a couple of weeks, refrigerated in an airtight container, Enjoy!</li>
